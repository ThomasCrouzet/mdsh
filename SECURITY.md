# Security policy

mdsh editor is a local-first static PWA with an optional Tauri Desktop Beta shell. It has no application backend, account, cloud synchronization, or telemetry. Browser drafts live in IndexedDB.

## Supported versions

| Version                         | Support     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Latest `1.x` release and `main` | Supported   |
| Older tags                      | Best effort |

## Report a vulnerability privately

Do not open a public issue for a security-sensitive finding. Use [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/ThomasCrouzet/mdsh/security/advisories/new). This is the private enforcement and conduct contact for this repository as well as the preferred security channel.

Include the version or commit, browser or operating system, reproduction steps, impact, and any planned disclosure. The solo maintainer aims to acknowledge a report within seven days on a best-effort basis. Disclosure timing is coordinated after a fix or an explicit risk decision.

## Browser threat model

In scope:

- script or markup injection through imported Markdown, reading mode, presentations, or exports;
- CSS or image requests that disclose network metadata without consent;
- a CSP or offline-shell bypass;
- silent IndexedDB loss, stale backups, or a false durability status;
- weaknesses in encrypted backup handling.

Rendering uses DOMPurify as the final sanitizer. CSS `url()` values in user content accept only validated local SVG fragments. The sanitizer removes SVG `feImage` filters to close that network request path. The app blocks remote images by default. It fetches them only after an explicit action for the document. An HTTPS fetch reveals the client IP address to the remote server. It sends no cookies or referrer and does not follow redirects. The app then embeds the validated bytes in the document. The project does not provide an image proxy.

The production CSP blocks unauthorized scripts, objects, forms, and external framing. It permits the HTTPS connections required for approved image fetches. It blocks direct image loading from an external origin. The media preparation layer still enforces consent. The editor, KaTeX, and Mermaid require inline styles. Before rendering, Mermaid diagrams reject images and network styles. They use native SVG labels and keep only drawing styles limited to the SVG. Standalone HTML exports contain no scripts or remote font dependencies.

## Desktop threat model

The Desktop Beta treats the WebView as potentially compromised. JavaScript cannot grant itself an arbitrary path. A native file picker or an operating-system file-open event canonicalizes an allowed path and creates an opaque, random, session-only capability token in Rust. Read, stat, and write commands accept that token rather than a path. Persisted browser records are not treated as native capabilities and require a fresh picker after restart.

Native file operations reject relative paths, parent traversal, unsupported extensions, and symlink substitutions. Writes use a same-directory temporary file, file synchronization, permission preservation, a final content-revision conflict check, atomic replacement, and directory synchronization where supported. An external edit requires an explicit user decision. Windows uses the native replace API for an existing target.

These boundaries reduce the impact of a WebView compromise but do not make an already compromised local operating-system account safe. Desktop installers remain unsigned beta artifacts until platform signing and notarization are available. There is no auto-update channel.

## Durability and backup limits

IndexedDB writes are debounced by 400 ms and flushed when the page becomes hidden, on page hide, and before relevant navigation. A rejected write makes the durability barrier fail closed and blocks backup, restore, and workspace replacement. A browser or device kill can still lose edits within the debounce window, and IndexedDB can be removed with browser profile data.

External backups include drafts, workspaces, and custom templates. They exclude trash, version history, File System Access handles, and Desktop capability tokens. Encrypted backups are unrecoverable without their passphrase.

## Supply chain

CI audits the complete npm tree and Cargo lockfile. It reviews dependency
changes, runs CodeQL, scans Git history for secrets, and verifies third-party
notices. Tests and bundle budgets are blocking. Release builds have no write
credentials. A separate final job publishes Desktop Beta artifacts. It includes
SHA-256 checksums, npm and Cargo SBOMs, and GitHub build provenance.

The Linux Tauri GTK3 toolchain still requires `glib 0.18.5`. The project applies the official fix for `GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g` and `RUSTSEC-2024-0429` in a local copy. It does not change the version or licenses. The repository contains the [provenance and patch](patches/glib/README.md). CI and Desktop publishing verify the official archive with SHA256. They apply the canonical patch, then compare each byte with the local copy. Six optimized Linux tests cover the affected iterators. The unpatched version causes SIGSEGV failures on nonempty paths. The Cargo SBOM keeps the actual version and describes the backport and its origin.

`cargo audit --deny unsound` also blocks undefined-behavior advisories. Cargo Audit does not check local dependencies as registry packages. Thus, no alert does not prove that the backport is correct. Provenance verification and optimized tests are separate blocking controls. Maintenance advisories remain visible. The project will remove the backport when the GTK toolchain accepts an officially fixed version.

Security controls and scanners reduce risk; they are not a guarantee that every vulnerability has been found.
