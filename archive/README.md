## Documents removed on 2026-09-26

Git retains these originals at revision `ef03dfe7bdab0cf807e8794cd5632a963638f6c1`.
The issue drafts duplicated maintenance work and used obsolete test or visual
rules. Remaining proposals are in [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). Screenshot
instructions and the asset list are in [BRANDING.md](../docs/BRANDING.md).
The five improvement priorities are now repeatable workflows in
[Testing](../docs/TESTING.md#durability-and-resource-pressure-evidence). Each run
retains its own results; this manifest is not a test report.
