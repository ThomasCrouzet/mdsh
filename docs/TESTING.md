# Test policy and evidence

Use E2E tests as the preferred verification method. Test observable results through
the application. For a complex change, write the workflow and its failure cases
before implementation. Never write unit tests after implementation.

If isolated tests are necessary, first record all identified failure risks. Explain
which risk each test detects and why the browser suite cannot detect it. Do not add
tests only to increase coverage. Do not test dependency internals, type contracts,
constant values, or mocked call sequences alone.

## Version 2.0 project risks

Write browser scenarios before implementation. Test the following failures through visible results and downloaded artifacts where possible.

- Old drafts or backups can lose documents during the schema upgrade. Keep a version 1.9 fixture and compare its complete content.
- Duplicate basenames can overwrite each other. Import separate directories with identical filenames and compare both exported files.
- Archive paths can escape the project root through absolute paths, traversal, encoding, or symlinks. Reject unsafe archives before storage changes.
- Large archives can exhaust memory or storage. Apply entry, depth, compressed, expanded, and image limits before atomic import.
- Missing assets, malformed images, and unsupported links can appear complete. Show a link report with precise document paths and destinations.
- Rendering can replace source image paths or contact a remote host. Compare source text and record requests during offline rendering.
- Visual editing can request a private relative image path before local asset resolution. Record requests for block and inline images.
- Renames can break incoming links, fragments, aliases, code samples, or documents with duplicate basenames. Check each destination after export.
- A storage failure can leave partial projects. Keep existing data and make failed writes visible.
- Backup merge can collide with project identifiers or paths. Keep a complete project copy and make repeated merges idempotent.
- Native directory access can escape through symlinks or stale grants. Check confinement, revocation, restart, and actual file contents.
- External edits can occur during comparison. Recheck the exact revision before overwrite or reload and retain the local version.
- Source preview can reset undo, lose the caret, or block typing. Check navigation, resizing, small screens, and a large document.
- A large comparison can block the interface. Bound comparison work and show any omitted context explicitly.
- A replacement preview can become stale. Refuse changed inputs and rebuild the preview before applying changes.

Feature scenarios cover [split view](testing/split-view.md), [comparisons](testing/diff-workflows.md), [project backups](testing/project-backup.md), and [native projects](testing/native-projects.md).

The browser filesystem workflow uses an OPFS file selected by its fixture.
It verifies cancellation, stale comparison rejection, reload, and a retained local checkpoint.
Browser file APIs cannot make the final revision check and write atomic against another application.

The portable project scenario verifies cached rendering after network loss.
Wait for the saved-state indicator before reloading a reopened document.
Service worker readiness does not confirm that the open tab state reached IndexedDB.
Chromium and Firefox use browser offline emulation.
WebKit uses a stopped origin server because [Playwright offline emulation can reject service worker responses](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/42775).
The report records the disruption and confirms service worker control.
This server outage check does not reproduce every operating system network condition.

## Retained isolated risks

The test review removed duplicate creation, selection, rendering, export, and
preference tests. Browser workflows verify those results. The remaining isolated
tests cover these additional risks:

| Area | Failure risks absent from the browser suite |
| --- | --- |
| Saves, trash, history, and workspaces | Write ordering, concurrent variants, rollback, history retention, invalid records, and failed durability barriers. |
| Native and browser disk access | Revoked permissions, stale capabilities, changed revisions, interrupted reads, rename rollback, and restart recovery. |
| Backup, crypto, and export | Malformed backups, linked ID remapping, authentication failure, invalid crypto parameters, name collisions, and cancellation cleanup. |
| Markdown, search, and media | Hostile CSS and SVG, parser time limits, code and YAML boundaries, Unicode matching, unsafe regexes, invalid images, and resource limits. |
| UI coordination | Competing prompts, rejected lazy imports, stale search results, worker timeouts, failed preference writes, and keyboard composition. |
| Release scripts and budgets | Incorrect checksums, missing installers, source identity, SBOM patch provenance, changelog boundaries, and shared-chunk accounting. |
| Native Rust code | Symlink substitution, persisted grants, file replacement, close ordering, and the GLib iterator security regression. |

Remove an isolated case when a reliable E2E test covers the same risk. Keep the
reason for each remaining case clear in its test name. `npm run test:coverage`
still reports coverage for diagnosis. No percentage target requires extra tests.

## Repeat the browser suite

### Heading navigation and editing controls

- The table of contents must remain available in Source, Edit, and Read modes.
  Check H1 through H6, duplicate headings, source line navigation, and live edits.
  Code examples and front matter must not create entries.
  Empty documents, narrow windows, and focus mode must not reserve a column.
- A delayed table of contents update can shift a link during pointer activation.
  Record the link geometry from its first visible frame until the column appears.
  Require stable geometry, deliver one normal click, and keep the target heading in the viewport.
  Retain the geometry JSON, final screenshot, HTML report, and failure trace.
- Heading level indicators must follow the pointer and caret without changing document content or exported files.
- The link editor must keep a text contrast ratio of at least 4.5 in the light theme.
  Wait for offline readiness before the fixture reload. An unfinished first installation can show a persistent update notice after reload.
- Delayed search results can move option buttons between pointer movement and activation.
  Record replacement-button geometry before and after results. Require one click at the original point to open replacement controls.
- Visual editor mark boundaries can consume an arrow key without moving the selection.
  Select the wiki alias text explicitly. Check the visible selection before replacement, then verify saved Markdown and navigation.
- A Markdown image without a title must open in Edit mode after a reload.
  Normalize absent parser titles before Milkdown validates image attributes.
  Preserve the source image, caption, and export bytes.
- Shortcut help must distinguish editing commands from configurable application commands.
  A changed binding must survive reload and execute its action once.

Run the heading, outline, link, and shortcut workflows with:

```sh
npm run test:e2e -- toc-modes.spec.ts heading-level.spec.ts link-theme.spec.ts keyboard-settings.spec.ts
```

Repeat the project anchor check with:

```sh
npm run test:e2e -- portable-projects.spec.ts --grep "same-document project links"
```

The browser report retains screenshots, fixtures, and measured link contrast.
Its source metadata identifies the commit and working diff.

### Durability and resource pressure risks

- A restored draft can appear unsaved after reload although its content is durable.
  Check the saved label after content restoration. Keep pending writes and write failures visible.
  Do not use an imported modification date as the local save time.
- A process kill before the 400 ms timer can lose the in-memory revision. An
  unload event is not a durability barrier. Record the last committed revision
  separately from the text that existed only in the editor.
- A kill during an IndexedDB transaction must retain the previous committed
  data. A completed backup or workspace barrier must survive a process restart.
- Concurrent saves must retain both branches, including the closed conflict
  copy. A failed conflict write must not replace the original draft.
- Large libraries can fill storage through drafts, history, and trash. Record
  both logical bytes and the browser storage estimate. A quota error must keep
  the save status in error and roll back the whole backup replacement.
- An export can stop at consent, media fetch, image decoding, stylesheet loading,
  or the native dialog. Cancellation must remove progress UI and print DOM,
  preserve edits and the dirty indicator, and permit the next export.
- An external process can replace, rename, or substitute a selected disk path
  while a save is staged. Native permission revocation must serialize with file
  writes. Check actual filesystem contents and retain each result.
- PDF inspection can exceed its deadline through per-pixel AppKit allocations.
  Keep all page images and pixel assertions, with a measured inspection budget.

These workflows use real browser processes, IndexedDB, and the native WebView.
Test-only gates select interruption points. They do not report simulated
filesystem or quota errors as native evidence.

### Durability and resource pressure evidence

Run the focused browser workflows with one worker:

```sh
npm run test:e2e -- abrupt-exit.spec.ts storage-pressure.spec.ts export-cancellation.spec.ts --project=chromium --workers=1
```

| Workflow | Observable result and artifact |
| --- | --- |
| `abrupt-exit.spec.ts` | SIGKILL before debounce, during a live transaction, and after backup, workspace, and conflict writes. The same profile reopens. `abrupt-exit.json` records process IDs, signals, before/after rows, lost memory-only text, and recoverable history. The backup case also retains its downloaded JSON. |
| `storage-pressure.spec.ts` | A seeded xorshift32 corpus has 300 drafts of 32 KiB, 9,000 history rows of about 2 KiB, and 100 trash entries. `storage-pressure.json` records timestamps, table counts, logical bytes, SHA-256 values, and Chromium usage/quota measurements. A real quota override rejects a save and replacement restore. Retry succeeds when quota returns. |
| `export-cancellation.spec.ts` | Cancel consent, a held image response, image decoding, CSS, fonts, and browser print preparation. Each case keeps the draft and dirty marker, removes progress within two seconds, and downloads a subsequent HTML export. |

The crash workflow delays only the save timer or holds a real IndexedDB
transaction at a known point. The transaction and conflict cases request a
flush first. SIGKILL itself does not run an unload handler.
On Unix, it kills the owned process group, including Chromium's storage and
rendering processes. Temporary-profile cleanup has bounded filesystem retries.
It tests browser-process loss, not device power loss or deletion of a profile.
The quota workflow waits 32 seconds for Chromium's bucket-space cache before
each constrained write. This avoids filling the host disk. The decoder workflow
holds the real bitmap operation until cancellation, then releases it to check
that a late result cannot trigger a download.

For native evidence, build and run in sequence:

```sh
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 BASE_PATH='' npm run tauri -- build --debug --features native-smoke --no-bundle --config src-tauri/tauri.smoke.conf.json
node scripts/native-smoke.mjs
```

`disk-races.json` records actual file replacement, external rename, native rename,
symlink substitution on Unix, and permission revocation before a pending write.
Test-only gates wait at most 15 seconds and are absent from normal builds.
On macOS, the runner cancels the actual Markdown, ZIP, HTML, and print panels
through AppKit. The result includes editor content and dirty state. A later
native print operation must produce a complete PDF.

The macOS runner compiles the PDF inspector once with `swiftc -O` (60 second
compile limit). It inspects two separate product exports. Each inspection has
a 20 second internal budget and a 30 second process deadline on both Apple
Silicon and Intel CI runners. The inspector renders every page to a 595 by 842
RGBA bitmap, counts both colored image bands, and checks A4 dimensions and the
final paragraph. It retains both PDFs, all PNG pages, extracted text, per-page
timings, and `native-pdf-inspection.json`, including under `repeated-pdf/`.
The parent `results.json` records source, environment, binary hash, and command.

Browser consent checks replace two isolated tests that asserted mocked export
calls. Native panel checks replace the old assumption that a frontend abort can
remove print content while an AppKit panel remains open. Isolated printer-error
and invalid-stylesheet checks remain because these workflows do not cause those
failures through the operating system.

### Image layout and native export risks

- Milkdown can mount an image node before its asynchronous proxy resolves. Never assign the relative Markdown source to the DOM image.
- Test existing and missing project images. Include block images, inline images, queries, and cross-tab document updates.
- Embedded image data can fill the source editor. Hide the payload with a keyboard-accessible
  control. Editing, undo, mode changes, reload, and Markdown export must preserve the bytes.
- A fixed image height can crop pixels when the PDF width guide or window becomes narrower.
  Check wide and tall images, image resize handles, and the saved scale.
- An image taller than the printable A4 area can cross a page boundary. Check its aspect ratio
  and the actual PDF, including the first and last rows of pixels.
- WebKit can display SVG while `createImageBitmap` rejects it. Use the native image decoder
  as a fallback and retain the image limits and sanitization.
- JavaScript `window.print()` can do nothing in WKWebView. The macOS test must use the product's
  native print operation and save a real PDF. A WebDriver screen capture is not equivalent.
- Native print cancellation, asset failure, repeated export, and a long-running dialog must
  restore the editor without deleting the print content before the operation completes.
- Replacing the macOS application menu can remove Hide, Services, Minimize, and Full Screen.
  Native edit commands must reach the active editor, including Undo and Redo. Application
  shortcuts must execute once and respect user overrides.
- Installer renaming can cause collisions or incorrect checksums. Keep architecture checks
  before collection and calculate checksums from the final published names.
- Presentation separators must stay inside code fences until a matching closing fence.
- An initial horizontal rule without a closing YAML marker must not hide source headings.
- An hourly service worker update can fail offline. Editing must remain usable without an
  unhandled rejection.
- Selection ZIP export must keep the content snapshot taken when the command starts.
- System theme changes must refresh diagram colors without replacing editor history.
- Reading mode must restore list markers removed by the global CSS reset. Check nested
  bullets, ordered-list start values, and task lists without duplicate markers.
- A Safari-compatible user agent can report a Linux keyboard platform. Prefer the platform
  for shortcut labels and keep native Control-only handling inside Desktop.
- The offline status label can change between pointer movement and a click.
  Keep the mode buttons at the same position through service worker activation.
  `toolbar-stability.spec.ts` holds real registration, then checks geometry and
  one pointer click in Chromium and Firefox.

Run the focused browser media workflows with:

```sh
npm run test:e2e -- project-media.spec.ts image-layout.spec.ts media-export.spec.ts source-fidelity.spec.ts portable-projects.spec.ts
```

The project media workflow records all requests for private relative paths.
It covers the initial mount and a cross-tab update of the same visual editor.
The attached ZIP contains existing and missing block and inline image fixtures.
The request artifact must contain an empty JSON array.

Run the native build command from `.github/workflows/desktop.yml`, then
`node scripts/native-smoke.mjs`. On macOS, `native-test-results/native.pdf` comes from
the same native print operation as the application. The test supplies a save destination
instead of a print panel. PDFKit checks A4 pages, the final paragraph, and both colored
image borders on one page. It writes page images and `native-pdf-inspection.json`.
Native menu checks inspect shortcut bindings and execute the associated AppKit actions.
Reports include the command, source SHA, working diff identity, binary hash, environment,
fixture, and results.

Use the Node version from `.node-version` and the committed lockfile:

```sh
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium firefox webkit
npx playwright test --ignore-snapshots --grep-invert "Snapshots visuels"
```

Playwright builds the application and starts a new preview server. Each workflow
uses a fresh browser context. Test helpers reset local data. Visual snapshots are
local-only, as specified in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#visual-tests-snapshots).

On a Linux host without a display, prefix the browser command with `xvfb-run -a`.
The scrollbar tests use headed Firefox because its headless mode hides native
scrollbars. CI supplies a virtual display for the same checks.

For the bulk deletion, PDF width, scrollbar, and heading-command workflows:

```sh
npm run test:e2e -- bulk-delete.spec.ts editor-width.spec.ts slash-commands.spec.ts
```

The deletion fixtures stop the browser context clock before the pending edit.
Separate clock installation and pause calls can race with real time and reject the pause timestamp.
Keep the edit, deletion, storage, and reload assertions active when correcting clock setup.
The cross-tab cases use real IndexedDB transactions and BroadcastChannel messages while editor and save timers remain stopped.

## Verify the artifacts

Every browser run produces:

- `playwright-report/index.html`: test results, steps, attachments, and Git metadata.
- `test-results/results.json`: machine-readable results, project settings, source metadata, and timing.
- `test-results/`: failed-test screenshots and traces, plus workflow attachments.
  The PDF width test attaches the actual A4 PDF that it measures.
  Cross-tab tests attach saved document and active-view evidence. Scrollbar tests
  attach screenshots and measured drag positions.

Open the HTML report with `npx playwright show-report playwright-report`. Inspect a
failed trace with `npx playwright show-trace <trace.zip>`. Use the report's file,
test title, and browser project to repeat one case with `--project` and `--grep`.

CI uploads `playwright-report` on success and failure and keeps it for 14 days.
The artifact belongs to the workflow run and its source commit. Compare that
commit with the release tag before using the results as release evidence.
Native WebView runs also upload `native-smoke-<platform>` artifacts.

Source preservation and library export limits use [source-fidelity.md](testing/source-fidelity.md).

## Version 2 accessibility

The project tree, split view, history comparison, and disk comparison must support keyboard operation.
Check initial focus, focus confinement, focus restoration, scroll access, and text contrast.

Run `npm run test:e2e -- v2-accessibility.spec.ts --project=chromium`.
The Playwright report retains screenshots and axe results.
Wait for interface animations before the contrast check. Keep all serious and critical violations as failures.
